# Getting started with the GitHub Checks API

### Workshop Pre-requisites

- A GitHub.com account
- A Glitch.com account
- Bring a ~t-shirt~ repository that you don't mind getting messy


### Extend and improve your app further
- Create a check saying “No new dependencies found” if the package.json file was not modified in the PR or commit
- Customise warning/notices
- Create a pull request review mentioning a specific team whenever there is a dependency change
- Add an [action button](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-23-request-actions-on-checks/) to "approve the dependency changes"
- Modify the check “conclusion” based on the changed dependencies
- Experiment further with the Checks API and build something completely different
